## Hello, I am Mishura / Miuna

### About me
I am a self-taught C++ developer. I am passionate about game development, but I can work on any software.
I am working as a freelancer, but looking for more stable employment. Feel free to send me a message if you have an offer!

### Key projects
 - Unannounced game project based on the Tesseract/Cube2 engine, as part of my freelance work.
 - [Octahedron](https://github.com/Mishura4/Octahedron) : In-progress and *very early* rewrite of the Tesseract engine in C++20 using modern code style and practices.
 - [B-12](https://github.com/Mishura4/B-12) : Discord bot written in C++ for my own use.
